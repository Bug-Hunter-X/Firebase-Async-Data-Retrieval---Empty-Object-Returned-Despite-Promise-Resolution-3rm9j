In a Firebase project, when attempting to access data from the Realtime Database asynchronously using `once('value')`, an error might occur where the data is not properly retrieved despite the promise resolving successfully.  This often manifests as an empty object or undefined value being returned, even though the database contains data. The issue might stem from how the asynchronous nature of the operation is handled, specifically the timing and context of accessing the data after the promise resolves.
